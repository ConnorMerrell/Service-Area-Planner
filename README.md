Process 1
Combine the centrepoints of ONS Middle Layer Super Output Areas with the associated population estimates. The population data will need to be edited to be compatable with the code.

Process 2

For each census area in population order (descending), places an asset in the centerpoint of each area until the area is fully served, excess capacity will then serve other areas in range.
Exports the assets into a csv file to export into a GIS program.
